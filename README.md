# BullScript [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mxcl/bs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mxcl/bs)

BullScript compiles to Javascript.

Alpha Quality
=============
The test-suite no doubt has holes. So you may have to fix some bugs if you use
it at this stage. Development of BS stalled due to other engagements, but when
we stopped devleoping it, it was working well!

Examples & Usage

Inline HTML Caveats
===================
You have to cleanly terminate your HTML tags. This is how the parser
determines where HTML ends. So if you start with a `<div>`, end with a `</div>`.
Though having said this, we understand tags like `<img>` too. Also you can do
this:

```js
var a = <div>foo</div>
        <b>blah</b>
var b = 2;
```

Additionally, (currently) the parser will be confused by JavaScript of this
kind:

```js
if (a <bc) { bar(); }
```

Heck, the above even breaks Sublime Textâ€™s Markdown syntax highlighting.
